# A/B Test 1
A/B Test Name: Background color customization

User Story Number: 

Metric: Retention

Hypothesis: Users with greater satisfaction with the cosmetics of the app are more likely to keep using it. 

Experiment: We release two versions of the app, which allows the user to change their background colors in different ways. We will keep track of how often each user checks their point count, because that will tell us if they enjoy looking at it. 

Variations: One will have 3 sliders, for each of the RGB values, and another will have a drop-down list of all the default colors available to us in Thunkable.
