# Engagement metrics: 
  - We would track the amount of times the average user changes their profile picture and customizes their app view. Through those numbers we would be able to show that our users are engaging with all of our additional features in the app.

# Retention Metrics:
  - Use google analytics to see what pages users are visiting the most so we can see what parts are working, and more importantly what parts are not working.
  - Use analytics to see how often users are logging in weekly to see if retention is waxing or waning.

# Adoption Metrics:
  - We'd track the number of accounts that are created just about every week through-out the life of our app by using FireBase backend data and maniuplating various features under user management. With this we can go about collecting necessary metrics.

# Task Success Metrics:
- We will keep track of how much the average point pool is increasing by each week
- (in the future if they can spend their points we'll need to account for that)
