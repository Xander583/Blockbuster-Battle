# Engagement metrics: 
  - We would track the amount of times the average user changes their profile picture and customizes their app view. Through those numbers we would be able to show that our users are engaging with all of our additional features in the app.

# Retention Metrics:
  - Use google analytics to see what pages users are visiting the most so we can see what parts are working, and more importantly what parts are not working.
  - Use analytics to see how often users are logging in weekly to see if retention is waxing or waning.
