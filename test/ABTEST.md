# A/B Test 1
A/B Test Name: Background color customization

User Story Number: US 4

Metric: Retention

Hypothesis: Users with greater satisfaction with the cosmetics of the app are more likely to keep using it. 

Experiment: We release two versions of the app, which allows the user to change their background colors in different ways. We will keep track of how often each user checks their point count, because that will tell us if they enjoy looking at it. 

Variations: One will have 3 sliders, for each of the RGB values, and another will have a drop-down list of all the default colors available to us in Thunkable. 

# A/B Test 2
A/B Test Name: Core concept "bounce" test

User Story Number: #35

Metric: Retention

Hypothesis: The motivation behind this A/B test is to guage the effectiveness of different ways we choose how we display some of our
app's "core" designs and function such as leaederboard positioning, points system, how these correlate to the user, etc. The result of testing this hypothesis should lead to a much better retention rate within our app,
while also letting us guage how engaging the layout and execution of our app is.
Experiment: This will be done in standard A/B fashion, where we can find two different ways for our app to essentially function. And then sepereate the userbase between the two. Once seperated 
this will allow for independent studies to be done on both and gauge google and firebase analytics to get a better understanding over how users interact with our app over a period of time.

Variations: The main variation or difference between the two options would be the way the movies are listed and selected, one would feature a listing utilizing an outside database with data taken from our API.
With the other making use of switches and buttons to feature better implementation for Thunkable users.
