Hypothesis:
The key part of a A/B test is formulating your hypothesis as this basically guides the whole A/B test plan. What problem are we trying to solve? Its impact? (e.g. how big this problem is to our customers?) In formulating the hypothesis, first you need to define the problem you want to solve. For example, you are an SaaS that offers free trial and you want to improve the traffic-to-lead conversion ratio (i.e. attracting more website visitors to actually sign up for a free trial). But that problem might be too broad to form an A/B test as you can simply test one variable in an A/B test to be effective (otherwise you won’t know which variable is causing the change). So to narrow down the problem you want to solve, you need to find out the bottle-neck in the conversion funnel – where do people drop off the most? Are there any key information or call-to-action buttons that you expect people to read/click but they didn’t?
