# CODE OF CONDUCT

### Decisions (How will they be made? Majority, consensus, other?) 
<br>

***Consensus first, then majority vote.***

---

### Attendance (What are your expectations for the frequency and type of attendance?; What are legitimate reasons for missing? What do missing members have to do to make up for missed meetings)
<br>
***Assume that we all show up, if not we reschedule.***

---
### Assignments (How will assignments be made? How will the group deal with members who do not complete (or poorly complete assignments?)
<br>

***Every week when we meet (in class and once outside of class) we assign work and create deadlines (both “hard” and “soft,” where things must be done by hard deadlines). If someone is struggling to meet a deadline they should ask for help from the rest of the group so that the deadline can be successfully met.***

---

### Participation (How will you communicate and share information; How will you ensure full participation of everyone? How will you honor member strengths and interests)? <br>

***We will watch each other to see that we are completing our assignments, and assign them according to what we are capable of doing.*** 

---

### Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums (How will you decide on locations and times that suit all members)? <br>

- ***4 pm Wednesday meetings over Discord***
- ***In-class meetings***


---
### Agenda and Minutes /Notes (Who will take them and in what format will they be shared?)<br>

***We will write down in a shared google doc at the start of the meeting what we will be going over, then we will each add notes as needed during the meeting.*** 

---
### Promptness (What do you expect and how will you handle lateness?) <br>
***Overall, no ghosting: if something comes up just let us know, whether that be about completing.***

---
### Conversational Courtesies (How will the team encourage and reinforce active listening, sharing of the airtime, tangents, respectful dialogue, etc ) <br>
***The more things on the agenda, the less tangents there should be. In addition, we shall take turns talking and listening, giving people the opportunity to say something if they want to.*** 

---
### Enforcement/ Feedback (How will the team enforce its own rules? How do individuals prefer to give and receive feedback?) <br>
***Give and receive feedback to each other as a group: if one of us has a suggestion, we tell the group and direct it at the person/people who are responsible.***
